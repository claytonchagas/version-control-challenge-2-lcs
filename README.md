# version-control-challenge-2-lcs

It's an implementation of the second challenge of version control by Professor Leonardo Murta :-)

This version is a first-level dynamic programming implementation.

In the future other forms of implementations will be presented, from naive implementation (brute force, complexity O(n*2^n)), to Miller & Myers algorithm (based on Shortest Edit Distance), in didactic mode.
